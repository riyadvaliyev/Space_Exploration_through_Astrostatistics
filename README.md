# Space_Exploration_through_Astrostatistics

This investigation was rooted in a fundamental curiosity to deepen our understanding of the cosmos and to shed light on the enigmas that surround celestial objects and their properties. By approaching our research questions from a statistical perspective, we aspired to uncover novel associations between various attributes of galaxies and account for their interrelationships. To achieve these objectives, we employed a range of statistical tools and techniques, including bootstrapping, constructing confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. The results of this study offer insight into the complex relationships that exist among stars and galaxies and provide a foundation of knowledge that can be applied to further exploration and investigation in this field. Ultimately, our aim was to enhance our comprehension of the universe and contribute to the advancement of astronomical research.
